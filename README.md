In this Notebook, we'll implement an agent <b>that plays OpenAI Taxi-V2.
The goal of this game is that our agent must <b>pick up the passenger at one location and drop him off to the goal as fast as possible.
There are 4 locations (labeled by different letters) and your job is to pick up the passenger at one location and drop him off in another.
- You receive +20 points for a successful dropoff.
- Lose 1 point for every timestep it takes. 
- There is also a 10 point penalty for illegal pick-up and drop-off actions (if you don't drop the passenger in one of the 3 other locations)"
